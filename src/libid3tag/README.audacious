The sources in libid3tag are heavily modified by the Audacious team for 
use in Audacious. If you are a package maintainer, please do not patch 
out this library as Audacious needs the modifications made here.

The modifications are as follows:
  - use the Audacious VFS subsystem for stream I/O instead of libc
  - add support for opening an id3 tagged file from a live VFS handle.
  - some minor portability improvements
