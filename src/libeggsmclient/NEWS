	* EggLauncher is now replaced by EggDesktopFile

	* egg_sm_client_register() is now gone, replaced by
          egg_set_desktop_file() and egg_sm_client_set_mode(). See the
          beginning of the "Using EggSMClient" section of README for
          details of how these work.

	* The state-saving machinery has changed; it's all based on
          keyfiles now. See the "More notes" section of README for an
          explanation of why this is cool.

	* egg_sm_client_end_session() no longer takes an EggSMClient;
          eventually it could be put somewhere entirely
          non-EggSMClient-related in the public API.

	* The win32 backend works now.
