This directory contains some tests. To run them, type "make".

Any needed uncompiled files in the audacious core will be compiled
with the proper CFLAGS. Don't worry about that.

You can help make this directory more useful by writing tests as
you fix bugs. Unless they're in the UI, autotesting that may be
problematic.

To write a test, simply edit an existing test and the Makefile
as required.
